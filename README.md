# funplot

Function Plot is a plotting library built on top of [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) used to render functions with little configuration (think of it as a clone of Google's plotting utility: $y=x2$)

The library currently supports interactive line charts and scatterplots, whenever the graph scale is modified the function is evaluated again with the new bounds, result: infinite graphs!

## Installation

You can install funplot from github with:


``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("JohnCoene/funplot")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:
